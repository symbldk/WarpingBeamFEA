# WarpingBeamFEA
FEA program to carry out frame analysis with restrained warping behavior.

## Elements included
- Space Truss
- 6 DOF conventional beam
- 6 DOF beam with effective torsion constant to consider warping
- 7 DOF warping beam element, including warping behavior as an additional degree of freedom

The program consists of a MATLAB code that performs the structural analysis and
two Microsoft Excel workbooks that are used to take inputs and write outputs. The
input spreadsheets are organized to take information regarding the joints, members,
support, and loading conditions of the analysis model. The output spreadsheets are
organized to report joint displacements, member forces, and support reactions.
